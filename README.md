# Exercism Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the **Java** track on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/java). The goal is to practice the language, develop logical thinking, improve the organization of Java projects, and track my progress.

Each exercise is in a separate folder with its own project structure, making it easy to run and maintain independently.

## 🧠 About the exercises

The exercises vary in difficulty and cover fundamental concepts of the Java language, such as:

- String manipulation
- Control structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Generic types
- Automated testing with JUnit
